# LangChain with Cohere and FAISS for Question Answering

This example demonstrates how to build a question-answering system using LangChain, Cohere, and FAISS. It leverages Cohere's large language models for embeddings and reranking, and FAISS for efficient vector search.

## Functionality

This code performs the following steps:

1. **Loads and prepares text data:**
   - Uses `TextLoader` to load a text file (`state_of_the_union.txt`).
   - Splits the text into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

2. **Creates a vector store:**
   - Embeds the text chunks using `CohereEmbeddings`.
   - Stores the embeddings in a FAISS vector store for efficient similarity search.

3. **Retrieves relevant information:**
   - Given a user query, retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the FAISS vector store.

4. **Compresses the context:**
   - Uses `CohereRerank` to rerank and select the most important chunks, reducing redundancy and noise.

5. **Answers the question:**
   - Employs a `RetrievalQA` chain with a Cohere language model to generate an answer based on the compressed context.

## Installation

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-cohere faiss-cpu tiktoken
```

## API Keys and Environment Variables

- **Cohere API Key:**
  - Obtain an API key from Cohere.
  - Set the `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable:

    ```bash
    export COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
    ```

  - Alternatively, you can provide the API key directly in the code:

    ```python
    import os
    os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = "your_cohere_api_key"
    ```

## Running the Code

1. **Save the code:** Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `qa_system.py`).
2. **Download the data:** Download the `state_of_the_union.txt` file and place it in the same directory as the code.
3. **Execute the code:** Run the script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python qa_system.py
   ```

This will load the data, build the QA system, and answer the example query. You can modify the query and experiment with different parameters to explore the capabilities of this system.

This README provides a clear overview of the functionality, installation instructions, and API key setup, making it easy for users to understand and run the code. It avoids including the entire code in the README, keeping it concise and focused on essential information.
